Link-sharing app
In this project, you'll build a fully-functional link-sharing app for developers! You'll practice working with image uploads, repeater fields, drag-and-drop, and more!

üìùBrief
Your challenge is to build out this link-sharing app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

Create, read, update, delete links and see previews in the mobile mockup
Receive validations if the links form is submitted without a URL or with the wrong URL pattern for the platform
Drag and drop links to reorder them
Add profile details like profile picture, first name, last name, and email
Receive validations if the profile details form is saved with no first or last name
Preview their devlinks profile and copy the link to their clipboard
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
Bonus: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)


üí°Ideas to test yourself
Build the project out as a full-stack application
Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
Use a JavaScript framework/library to practice templating and/or building using components
Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is important for professional developers
